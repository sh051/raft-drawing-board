# Mini-RAFT Distributed Drawing Board

A fault-tolerant, real-time collaborative drawing application built using a **Mini-RAFT consensus protocol**.

This project simulates real-world distributed systems used in cloud infrastructure (like Kubernetes, etcd, Consul).

---

## Features

- Real-time collaborative drawing (WebSockets)
- Distributed system with 3 replicas
- Leader election (RAFT-like)
- Log replication & consistency
- Automatic failover handling
- Zero-downtime replica reload
- State synchronization on restart

---

## Components

### Frontend
- HTML Canvas-based UI
- Real-time drawing using mouse/touch
- Receives updates via WebSocket

---

### Gateway (WebSocket Server)
- Handles all client connections
- Routes drawing events to leader
- Broadcasts committed strokes
- Detects leader changes and re-routes dynamically

---

### Replica Nodes (3 instances)

Each replica implements a **Mini-RAFT protocol**:

#### States
- Follower
- Candidate
- Leader

#### Responsibilities
- Maintain append-only stroke log
- Participate in leader election
- Replicate logs across cluster
- Commit entries on majority agreement
- Sync logs after restart

#### RPC Endpoints
- `/request-vote`
- `/append-entries`
- `/heartbeat`
- `/sync-log`

---

## Mini-RAFT Protocol

### Leader Election
- Timeout: 500–800ms
- Follower → Candidate if heartbeat missing
- Majority votes → Leader

### Heartbeat
- Interval: 150ms

### Log Replication
1. Client → Gateway → Leader
2. Leader appends to log
3. Sends to followers
4. Majority confirms
5. Entry committed
6. Broadcast to clients

### Safety Guarantees
- No overwriting committed logs
- Higher term always wins
- Majority quorum required

---

## Fault Tolerance

✔ Leader crash → automatic re-election  
✔ Replica restart → state sync  
✔ Hot reload → zero downtime  
✔ Multiple failures → system still consistent

## Running the Project

### 1. Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sh051/raft-drawing-board
cd raft-drawing-board

```
### 2. Install dependencies
```

cd gateway && npm install
cd ../replica1 && npm install
cd ../replica2 && npm install
cd ../replica3 && npm install

```

### 3. Run servers
```
node server.js   # in replica1
node server.js   # in replica2
node server.js   # in replica3
node server.js   # in gateway

```

### 4. Run frontend\
```
cd frontend
npx http-server
```

### Open
```
